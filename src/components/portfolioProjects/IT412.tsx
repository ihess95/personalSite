        1. Information Technology Structure Description
        <br />
        This is a risk analysis for ABC Healthcare; a small startup with 50
        employees. There is a serious lack of cyber security standards adhered
        to in the current network topography. As it stands, anyone with a
        computer can access our open wireless network, and with a little
        knowledge, will have access to our Healthcare data server and all the
        personally identifiable information stored on it. ABC Healthcare needs
        to amend this as soon as possible or risk consequences of violating many
        cyberlaws, including HIPAA and COBRA. ABC Healthcare's network has no
        firewall, a necessary part of any secure network.
        <br />
        Firewalls restrict access to anything behind them. Ideally ABC
        Healthcare would implement two. The first firewall would be set up after
        the router, protecting our network from the wider internet. The second
        firewall would be in front of the healthcare data server, preventing
        unauthorized access from this server. This also means that not just
        anyone connected to our local network can access this sensitive data.
        This leads us to the company's current wireless network.
        <br />
        As it stands, guests who access our free wireless network are allowed
        access to the same network our employees use. This needs to change, as
        it is an inherent security flaw. By creating a guest network, we can
        offer customers wireless internet, while preventing them from having
        access to our important work network. This will prevent guests from
        being able to access or even see our network topology, a huge plus for
        cyber security.
        <br />
        Currently, ABC Healthcare allows employees to access personal emails and
        perform web browsing not related to work on their work systems.
        Unfortunately, this presents another major security flaw. No company
        should have glaring security issues, but it is unacceptable for a
        company that locally stores healthcare information for clients.
        Employees can use their personal phones to access the guest network to
        accomplish this instead.
        <br />
        In addition to these network topology concerns, there are a few other
        cybersecurity issues that need to be addressed. Instead of properly
        setting up our network to be as safe as possible, ABC Healthcare
        installed a video monitoring system. The employees were not informed of
        this, which brings up a host of ethics violations, more on that later.
        While a video monitoring system can be a useful addition to company
        security posture, it is not a solution, and all employees should be made
        aware when and where they are being filmed. ABC Healthcare also recycles
        unused copies without shredding them. This is another major security
        flaw. All copies should be shredded before being disposed of to prevent
        possible secure information leaks.
        <br />
        2. Cyberlaws and Ethics Regulations Pertaining to ABC Healthcare
        <br />
        Any healthcare provider must adhere to the Health Insurance Portability
        and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA was established to provide a
        national standard that protects personal health information. Part of the
        goal of HIPAA is to protect this data, while also allowing its transfer
        and use in the health industry. (U.S. Department of Health and Human
        Services, 2022) HIPAA could completely lock down all information, but
        then that information would be useless and just a liability for
        companies. By regulating standards that allow information transfer in a
        protected way, the information is kept safe and confidential, while
        still being usable. In section (e)(1) of the HIPAA Administrative
        Simplification Regulation Text Transmission security is defined as
        "Implement(ing) technical security measures to guard against
        unauthorized access to electronic protected health information that is
        being transmitted over an electronic communications network." This is
        exactly what the first section of this risk assessment aims to address.
        <br />
        The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
        (HITECH) is an addendum to HIPAA that aims to improve quality, safety
        and efficiency of care as well as ensure privacy and security among
        other goals. HITECH also came with harsher penalties for violating
        HIPAA. Under our current infrastructure ABC Healthcare violates HIPAA
        and HITECH, meaning we will experience the harsher prenalty
        <br />
        In addition to laws that ABC Healthcare may be infringing on, there are
        many ethical regulations that are not being followed. While ethical
        regulations are not laws, adhering to them may help make the company a
        better place for customers and employees. There are companies that set
        up their own code of ethics, and there are outside agencies that create
        more general codes for companies to follow, such as the Information
        Systems Security Association (ISSA). ISSA defines practices that help
        companies uphold the CIA triad of information security more easily and
        effectively. The CIA triad refers to confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability of information used by the company. Some of the ethics
        defined by ISSA are ";Performing all professional activities in
        accordance with applicable laws and the highest ethical principles." By
        adhering to the advice given in this risk assessment, ABC Healthcare
        will already be in line with this rule, as well as the following rule,
        ";promote generally accepted information security current best practices
        and standards." There are other more general guidelines such as ";be
        diligent and honest" and ";refrain from activities which may create a
        conflict of interest or damage company reputation." (ISSA 2019)
        <br />
        3. Ethics Violations
        <br />
        a. Unethical behaviors - Personal or Professional
        <br />
        There are many unethical behaviors detailed in the company debrief and
        mentioned in the first section of this risk assessment. ISSA's ethical
        regulations' first rule is to do things by the book, following the law.
        As previously stated, there are plenty of laws we have broken, and best
        practices that have not been implemented. This is an ethical violation
        under ISSA's guidelines. The previous violations were professional
        violations. Another professional violation is not shredding important
        documents. This violation can lead to leaked sensitive information and,
        as a healthcare organization, it is ABC Healthcare's professional duty
        to prevent this to the best of the companies' ability. ISSA also asks
        that employees refrain from any activities that can damage the
        reputation of the company. Not disclosing video monitoring is a textbook
        example of a violation of this guideline. This is a personal violation.
        People deserve to know when they are being filmed.
        <br />
        b. Unethical behaviors - Impact on IT and computing with ABC Healthcare
        <br />
        The listed unethical behaviors have varying implications for the
        information technology infrastructure at ABC Healthcare. Professional
        violations have more direct consequences than personal ones. This is not
        to say personal ethical violations have no impact. Employees are the
        number one security threat in cyber security. If an employee is
        mistreated, they can leak private information and get the company into a
        lot of unnecessary trouble. Professional violations, including poorly
        constructed network infrastructure, improperly discarded documents, and
        exposed networks cause a litany of cybersecurity vulnerabilities that
        can be easily exploited. If a bad actor got a hold of any of these
        vulnerabilities, ABC Healthcare should be ready for several technical
        difficulties, network outages and even lawsuits. This will cause the
        company to significantly more money than being proactive and upgrading
        the system to reflect industry standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Cyberlaw noncompliance <br />
        ABC Healthcare runs the risk of violating many cyberlaws under its
        current network configuration and policies. There are many US laws that
        pertain to companies and their network infrastructure. The Federal
        Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is one of the most important
        of these laws. FISMA was created as a response to the 9/11 terrorist
        attacks as a means for the United States government to oversee company
        information security to guarantee citizens safety. Over time, FISMA has
        been updated to reflect modern information security standards. While
        FISMA pertains to federal IT systems, which are defined as any IT system
        that holds military information, and ABC Healthcare does not have
        federal IT systems, it is an important guideline to follow. For our
        purposes the Act requires companies to create adequate policies to
        reduce cyber security risks, implement security training, test security,
        and have reasonable recovery and continuity plans. ABC Healthcare has
        none of these requirements. Again, ABC Healthcare is not a federal
        company, and does not work in the defense sector, but as a healthcare
        company, it is important to look at cyberlaws that hold companies to
        strict standards.
        <br />
        As a healthcare company, ABC Healthcare must follow HIPAA, or be
        persecuted. HIPAA is a law created to protect the privacy of individuals
        in a healthcare environment. HIPAA ensures that companies take the
        proper steps to protect personal medical information for their
        customers. An important part of HIPAA is the protection of the transfer
        of this data. According to the American Medical Association: "Failure to
        comply with HIPA can result in civil and criminal penalties" (American
        Medical Association), for civil penalties, willful violation can result
        in a fine up to $50,000 per violation. Criminal penalties can result in
        fines of up to $250,000 and imprisonment of up to ten years. The
        department of justice "interpreted knowingly' as requiring only
        knowledge of the actions that constitute an offense. Specific knowledge
        of an action being in violation of the HIPAA statute is not required."
        (American Medial Association) This means that as ABC Healthcare has
        operated, it could be punished under HIPAA.
        <br />
        HITECH is another act that ABC Healthcare is violating. The Health
        Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health was enacted as
        part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment act of 2009. HITECH
        serves to strengthen enforcement of HIPAA rules. HITECH established four
        levels of culpability, corresponding fines, and a maximum penalty of
        $1.5 million.
        <br />
        Currently, ABC Healthcare allows staff members to bring in their own
        laptops to perform company work on the company network with. This is a
        huge security risk, and a violation of all three acts previously
        mentioned. Devices not maintained by the company are a liability and may
        be compromised. It is recommended that companies run in a zero-trust
        environment for this reason. Currently, we are not set up in this way,
        allowing an infected computer on our LAN to run amok in it. Similarly,
        we allow customers and guests to connect to the same network we do our
        work on, another huge violation. By simply setting up a guest network,
        we can avoid a lot of trouble in the future. This is also the network
        that employee personal devices should be connected to. This may be
        inconvenient for our employees, but it is an important security
        precaution. This leads us to our next section.
        <br />
        5.Acceptable use-of-technology policies
        <br />
        As it stands, ABC Healthcare has no acceptable use policies in place.
        There are no guidelines for our employees to follow; they have no
        training to know they are doing anything that could adversely affect the
        company. To help ABC Healthcare create its own acceptable use policy, we
        will look at other companies' policies, compare them, and see what
        applies to our use case. We will be looking at the Information Systems
        Security Association (ISSA) AUP and the AT&T AUP. ISSA has a more
        general AUP that will likely apply to our situation more than the AT&T
        one, which focuses on network usage from an internet service provider
        point of view.
        <br />
        AT&T prohibits use of their IP services for unlawful, harmful reasons as
        well as prohibiting the use of their network to interfere with other
        user's network use. Activities that are prohibited include but are not
        limited to violations of intellectual property rights, threatening
        material, inappropriate interaction with minors and more. Customers also
        may not use AT&T's services for actions considered security violations,
        including unauthorized monitoring, probing, or scanning of networks,
        hacking, impersonating others, engaging in piracy and more. ";Customers
        are held fully accountable for their actions and failure to observe the
        guidelines can result in service termination." (AT&T) These rules are
        good for inspiration for ABC Healthcare, but do not directly apply. We
        are not providing our customers with IP services as our business,
        however we can and should hold our employees to similar policies, as
        well as anyone using our guest network.
        <br />
        ISSA provides a more general acceptable use policy that may be more
        pertinent to our operation. Guidelines in this AUP include, performing
        professional activities in accordance with laws and ethical principles,
        promote security best practices where applicable, maintain
        confidentiality, be diligent and honest, do not engage in activities
        that may result in conflicts of interest or damage employer reputation
        and more. Example activities include using profanity, providing
        unauthorized access to the network, willingly putting viruses on company
        systems and more. Their punishment is removing posts from their forum,
        which is not a punishment relevant to us.
        <br />
        To make these policies fit our organization better, we must adapt them.
        For instance, both policies have sections focused on prohibiting users
        from breaking laws and causing problems with their platforms. We should
        do the same. ABC Healthcare should implement an AUP that prohibits
        anyone on our network from using it for nefarious, unprofessional
        reasons, like the ones listed in both AT&T and ISSA's AUPs. We should
        also write a section that is specific to the healthcare industry. Users
        may not access personal Health Information of other customers knowingly.
        The punishment for failing to comply with our AUP must be different than
        the other companies as well. We can remove employees and customers from
        the internet, but doing so may prevent them from being able to
        accomplish the tasks they need. Employees will need to be reprimanded in
        another way, maybe a suspension or termination depending on the
        seriousness of the violation. Customers can likely just have their
        access to the complimentary network revoked.
        <br />
        6. Code of Ethics
        <br />
        A code of ethics is an important part of a cybersecurity posture. One of
        the most important pieces of the cybersecurity puzzle is employees.
        Employees are the easiest vector of compromise in the cyber world. The
        best way to help employees be more secure users is to develop a company
        culture that supports this goal. A code of ethics is a ground rule that
        supports the goal. ISSA again has an appropriate code of ethics that ABC
        Healthcare can learn from. Their code promotes employees to perform in
        accordance with laws and ethical standard, promote information security
        best practices, maintain confidentiality, be diligent in
        responsibilities and honesty, refrain from harmful activities and do not
        intentionally injure colleague, client, or employer reputation. Again,
        we can look at AT&T as well. AT&T defines their values and then expounds
        on how employees can use their code of ethics to uphold these values.
        The values are Live true - do the right thing, think big, pursue
        excellence, be there, stand for equality and make a difference. AT&T's
        code applies much more to the company culture than ISSA's does. Where
        ISSA uses plain and professional language to convey its codes, AT&T uses
        more casual and personal language. Perform in accordance with laws and
        ethical standards vs ";live true." AT&T also focuses more heavily on
        interpersonal conduct than ISSA. AT&T's values consist of personal goals
        and how that can move the company forward, whereas ISSA just states how
        to comply with the rules.
        <br />
        ABC Healthcare can learn from these companies to create a code of ethics
        that functions as not only a guideline for company culture but also a
        way to reinforce personal goals. Our values should be adapted from
        these. ABC Healthcare needs its employees, as a healthcare company, to
        uphold the utmost respect for the work they do, and as a relatively
        small business should have the time and personality to care about the
        personal growth of all employees. Our code of ethics should include
        performing duties with respect and to the utmost of our abilities, in
        accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Employees should
        strive to be the best they can at whatever their job is. Employees
        should be encouraged to report anything that makes them uncomfortable,
        and they should see real results when they do. Employees should be
        taught basic cybersecurity best practices to allow them to uphold this
        standard. Employees should refrain from damaging the reputation of
        colleagues, clientele, and employers.
